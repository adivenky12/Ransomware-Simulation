# üîê Ransomware Simulation Project

This project demonstrates a basic simulation of ransomware behavior, including encryption, decryption, and mitigation strategies. It is intended **strictly for educational and ethical cybersecurity learning**.

## üß† What‚Äôs Included

- `encryption.py` ‚Äì Simulates encrypting files using a symmetric key
- `decryption.py` ‚Äì Decrypts files that were encrypted by the ransomware
- `mitigation.py` ‚Äì Provides potential methods to detect or prevent ransomware activity

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- No external libraries (standard Python crypto modules or base64 likely used)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Clone or extract the project**
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Run encryption:
```bash
python encryption.py
```

4. Run decryption (after encryption completes):
```bash
python decryption.py
```

5. To explore mitigation:
```bash
python mitigation.py
```
