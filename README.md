# üîê Ransomware Simulation Project

This project demonstrates a basic simulation of ransomware behavior, including encryption, decryption, and mitigation strategies. It is intended **strictly for educational and ethical cybersecurity learning**.

## üß† What‚Äôs Included

- `encryption.py` ‚Äì Simulates encrypting files using a symmetric key
- `decryption.py` ‚Äì Decrypts files that were encrypted by the ransomware
- `mitigation.py` ‚Äì Provides potential methods to detect or prevent ransomware activity

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- No external libraries (standard Python crypto modules or base64 likely used)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Run only in a controlled/test environment** ‚Äî this is a ransomware simulation and should not be used on production or personal systems.

1. **Clone or extract the project**
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Run encryption:
```bash
python encryption.py
```

4. Run decryption (after encryption completes):
```bash
python decryption.py
```

5. To explore mitigation:
```bash
python mitigation.py
```

## üõ° Ethical Use

This project is for **ethical, academic, and awareness purposes only.** Do not deploy or use this in real-world environments.

## üöÄ Uploading to GitHub

1. Create a new GitHub repo: `Ransomware-Simulation`  
2. In your local terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/Ransomware-main
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Ransomware Simulation"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Ransomware-Simulation.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.
